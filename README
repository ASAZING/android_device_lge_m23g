Few words about mtk related binaries, services and migration peculiarities.

# Limitations

Services requires root:

  * surfaceflinger depends on sched_setscheduler calls, unable to change process priority from 'system' user (default user 'system')

  * mediaserver depends on /data/nvram folder access, unable to do voice calls from 'media' user (default user 'media')
